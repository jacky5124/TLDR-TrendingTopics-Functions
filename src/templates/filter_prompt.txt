I saw a trending topic online, and I found a news article under that trending topic.

The news article is presented by the following JSON format:

{
    "title": The title of the news article.
    "url": The source URL of the news article.
    "description": The description for the news article.
    "extra_snippets": A list of extra alternative snippets for the news article.
}

And the actual contents are as follows:

Trending topic: ${topic}
Trending topic news: ${news}

Can you determine whether the news article is relevant to the trending topic?

You must only answer "true" if it is relevant or "false" if it is not relevant.
